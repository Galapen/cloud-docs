# cloud-brigadier

[Brigadier](https://github.com/mojang/brigadier) is Mojang's command system. Cloud integrates with Brigadier on platforms
where this is supported. Unless you want to create a platform integration it is unlikely that you will want to depend
on `cloud-brigadier` directly. Instead, you are able to interact with Brigadier through the platform integration.
